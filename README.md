Emotion Classifier


# 😊 Emotion Classifier  

## 🧠 About  
This is a **basic NLP project** built to classify text into different **emotions** such as *Happy*, *Sad*, *Neutral*, and *Angry*.  
It was created as part of my **learning journey in Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to understand how models handle textual data and predict emotions from sentences.  

---

## 🎯 Project Objective  
To predict the **emotion** expressed in a given piece of text using fundamental **NLP preprocessing techniques** and **machine learning models**.

---

## 🧩 Key Learnings  
This project helped me explore and practice core NLP concepts like:  
- **Text Preprocessing:** Cleaning and normalizing text using libraries like *Neatest* (built specifically for text cleaning).  
- **Feature Extraction:**  
  - **CountVectorizer** – to convert text into token count vectors.  
  - **TF-IDF Vectorization** – to give importance to unique words in text.  
- **Modeling:**  
  - Implemented a **Logistic Regression** classifier to predict emotion labels.  
- **Pipeline Creation:**  
  Combined preprocessing and modeling steps into a clean **ML pipeline**.

## ⚙️ Workflow  

1. **Data Preparation:**  
   Load and clean the text dataset using the *Neatest* library.  

2. **Text Vectorization:**  
   Convert cleaned text into numerical form using **CountVectorizer** and **TF-IDF**.  

3. **Model Training:**  
   Train a **Logistic Regression** model on the vectorized text.  

4. **Prediction:**  
   Input a new text → get the predicted emotion.

## 💡 Purpose  
This project was created **for learning purposes only** — to explore how NLP techniques like **vectorization**, **text preprocessing**, and **classification** work together.  
It helped me understand how to deal with **text data**, handle issues like noise and imbalance, and build a complete pipeline from raw text to prediction.
